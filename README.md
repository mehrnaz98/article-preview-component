## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox for layout
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- JavaScript for toggling share options

### What I Learned

This project helped me improve my skills in responsive design using Flexbox and Tailwind CSS. I also practiced adding interactivity with JavaScript by implementing a toggle function for the share options.

### Continued Development

I plan to further develop my skills in interactive components using JavaScript and explore more complex layout techniques with Tailwind CSS.

### Useful Resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - Helped me understand Tailwind CSS utility classes.
- [MDN Web Docs on JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - A great reference for JavaScript functionality.
